## 💡 Pro Tips

### Start Small:
```
Don't build everything at once!

Recommended first 3 features:
1. Mobile Wallet (1 week) - Quick professional win
2. PWA (2 weeks) - Foundation for future
3. User Feed (4 weeks) - Biggest impact

Total: 7 weeks to transform platform
```

### Measure Everything:
```
Track these metrics from day 1:
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Average session time
- Posts per user per week
- Ticket sales from feed discovery
- Resale transaction volume
- Revenue per user
- Viral coefficient (k)

Set goals:
Month 3: 10% DAU (vs 5% current)
Month 6: 25% DAU
Month 12: 40% DAU
```

### Get Feedback Early:
```
Before building each feature:
1. Show mockup to 10 users
2. Ask: "Would you use this?"
3. Ask: "What's confusing?"
4. Iterate design based on feedback
5. THEN start coding

Saves weeks of development time!
```

### Build Iteratively:
```
Feed v1: Photos only (2 weeks)
Feed v2: Add videos (1 week)
Feed v3: Add stories (1 week)
Feed v4: Add AR filters (2 weeks)

Don't build v4 on day 1!
Launch v1, get users, iterate.
```
